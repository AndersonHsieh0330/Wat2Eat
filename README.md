You ever get really hungry but have no idea what food is available in your area? Or just tired of having the same stuff everyday? Wat2Eat is here to let you know what food is available around you!

I often found myself scrolling on Google map and checking each little food tags to find an open restaurant to get food from. So I thought why not make an app that shows all opening restaurant and save some time?

The focus of this app is around sending an API request and dealing with JSON data response. 

Wat2Eat supports:
- Getting user's current location
- Fetching data and filtering for restaurnats that are open within 500m radius of a user

Some new things Iâ€™ve learned:
- Transitioning from Java to Kotlin 
- Restful APIs
- Send http request with Volley as HTTP client
- Presenting JSON data response from API
- FusedLocationClient for fetching the geocode
- Runtime permission request 
- Presenting image links: Glide

Libraries and resources I used 
- Volley
- Glide
- FusedLocationClient API
- Google places APIs: Nearby Search, Place Detail, Place Photo
