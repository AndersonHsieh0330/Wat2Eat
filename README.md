# Wat2Eat
You ever gotten really hungry but have no idea what food is available in your area? Or just tired of having the same stuff every day? Wat2Eat is here to let you know what food is available around you! Check out on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andyh.wat2eat)

<br/>
I often found myself scrolling on Google map and checking each little food tag to find an open restaurant to get food from. So I thought why not make an app that shows all opening restaurants and save some time? The focus of this app is around sending an API request and dealing with JSON data response. Each time user starts the app, all the opening restaurants within 500m are fetched, and each time the user presses the search button, one GET request for the details of the restaurant is sent.


## Wat2Eat supports:
- Getting user's current location
- Fetching and filtering restaurant data for restaurants that are open within 500m radius of the user's location

## Some new things I’ve learned:
- Transitioning from Java to Kotlin 
- Restful APIs
- Send http request with Volley as HTTP client
- Presenting JSON data response from API
- FusedLocationClient for fetching the geocode
- Runtime permission request 
- Presenting image links: Glide
- How to attribute resources used in a app and software licenses
- How to publish an app to Google Play Store
- Activity BackStak

## Libraries and resources I used 
- Volley
- Glide
- FusedLocationClient API (for Geolocation)
- Google places APIs: Nearby Search, Place Detail, Place Photo

As well as any of the nessecary guildlines in Google Maps Platform Terms of Service(https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/terms/#3.-license.). These terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Hsieh Heng-An.

For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason.

The Wat2Eat app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide my Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device.

The app does use third party services that declare their own Terms and Conditions.

You should be aware that there are certain things that Hsieh Heng-An will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but Hsieh Heng-An cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.

If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.

Along the same lines, Hsieh Heng-An cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Hsieh Heng-An cannot accept responsibility.

With respect to Hsieh Heng-An’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. Hsieh Heng-An accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.

At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android – the requirements for system(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Hsieh Heng-An does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.
